The flow works as follows:
User clicks "Forgot your password?" on the login page
They enter their email on the forgot password page
Backend generates a reset token and stores it (in production, would send email)
User receives reset link (in development, token is returned in response)
User clicks link and is taken to reset password page
User enters new password and confirms it
Backend verifies token and updates password
User is redirected to login page
Note: In a production environment, you would want to:
Implement actual email sending functionality
Remove the devToken from the response
Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
Add additional security measures like IP tracking
